# KotlinPractice2024

As is typical for me when teaching myself a
new programming language, I am going to implement
several classical algorithms, such as bubblesort
and mergesort in the new language--this time Kotlin.

Note that this is an iterative process. It's more
about learning than efficiency, and I usually try
to remember the algorithms and re-write them 
manualy from memory, so mis-steps are common and
I see no problem there because I will include tests
and I will find any errors.

The primary goal here is to learn Kotlin, so I
will be trying not just to faithfully reproduce
these classic algorithms, but also to write idiomatic
Kotlin.
